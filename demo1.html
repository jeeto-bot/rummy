            <div>
                <p>Out of all the card games that most people play, Indian Rummy happens to be one of the most popular
                    ones. Its multiple variants make it ideal for different groups of people. If you are new to this
                    exciting game, you must learn all you can about these different variations.&nbsp;</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are three popular variants in Indian rummy, known as pool rummy, deals rummy and points rummy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Pool Rummy: </strong> playing 101 <a
                        href="https://www.rummyculture.com/rummy-variations/pool-rummy-game">pool rummy</a>, you must
                    ensure that your players&nbsp; opponents make more than 101 points. Conversely Similarly, when
                    playing 201 pool rummy, you must ensure that the other players make more than 201 points, while
                    still keeping your own points under 201.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Points Rummy: </strong>Also called 80 <a
                        href="https://www.rummyculture.com/rummy-variations/points-rummy-game">points rummy</a>, this
                    game is the most basic version of Rummy and many beginners enjoy this format before progressing onto
                    harder ones. In this, players can choose point values that they are comfortable with (for instance,
                    ₹100 per point) and then play accordingly.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Deals Rummy:</strong> As the name suggests, <a
                        href="https://www.rummyculture.com/rummy-variations/deals-rummy-game/">deals rummy</a> is played
                    for a specific number of deals. At the beginning of the game, players get a number of chips. At the
                    end of the last deal, players are ranked on the basis of the chips they have.<br></p>

            <div>
                <h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Is it legal to play online rummy at Rummyculture.com?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Most definitely – <strong><em>Yes</em></strong>. Playing rummy online at RummyCulture is legal as
                    stated by the Supreme Court of India. . The Court ruled in the year 1968 that rummy is a game of
                    skill. In 1996, the Supreme Court of India also stated that (i) a competition where chances of
                    success depend on a significant degree of skill is not gambling, and (ii) despite the fact that
                    there is an element of chance, rummy is preponderantly a game of skill and thus may be considered a
                    game of ‘mere skill.’<br></p>
                <br>
                <h3>Does playing rummy online categorise as ‘Gambling’?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Short answer – <strong><em>No</em></strong>. The Constitution of India has a definition for gambling
                    which reads like this: “gambling includes any activity or undertaking whose determination is
                    controlled or influenced by chance or accident or any activity or undertaking which is entered into
                    or undertaken with consciousness of the risk of winning or losing (eg, prize competitions, a
                    wagering contract)”</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Supreme Court of India has identified rummy as a game of skill and not just chance, hence
                    differentiating it from gambling. Therefore, the activity to play rummy for cash in a game of skill
                    is protected under the Indian Constitution – <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India#Freedom_of_trade">Article
                        19(1)(g)</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, in Assam, Orissa and Telangana, players are not allowed to play rummy for cash. RummyCulture
                    does not allow players from these states to play rummy for real money. But, they can still play our
